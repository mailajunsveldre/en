You can use regluar text editor for coding but as its name says IDE has a lot of plugins and features integrated specific for coding and software development that automate routine tasks and maximize productivity.</p><p>Main features of IDE are:</p><ul><li><strong>Syntax highlighting</strong> - for language keywords, code structure and errors. Different colors are used.</li><li><strong>Code completion</strong> - some parts of the code are very repetitive, this feature helps to speed up coding.</li><li><strong>Recactoring</strong> - if we don&#39;t have syntax errors computer understands code but readability is also important for humans. This is achieved by whitespaces - spaces, tabs, new lines and empty lines. This feature can automate the process.</li><li><strong>Version control</strong> - we address version control in next topic but this feature allows automate the process of sharing code with your team.</li><li><strong>Debugging</strong> - sometimes we need to slow down the execution of program - follow instructions step by step and see what are the values of variables in certain state of program.</li></ul><p>Currently one of the most popular IDEs is <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>. I recommend a Youtube video which should give you overview of VS Code but also general idea of IDE&#39;s features. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPqXP_kLzpo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code Crash Course</a></p>',5);a.render=function(o,r,a,i,n,d){return e(),t("div",null,[s])};export default a;export{r as __pageData};
