Typically there are multiple versions of the same software developed, ecpecially when working in teams. In some versions developers fix bugs and other versions have new features developed. To handle version control we use special software. There are more than one but today most used in software development is Git. <strong>Git</strong> is free and also open source. Git is a software installed in your local development environment or as a cloud service somewhere in the server. To communicate and sync with your team you need to use both - local repository and remote repository somewhere in the cloud. You could install your own Git server for your team or use git cloud service.
