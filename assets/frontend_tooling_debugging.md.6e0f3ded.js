Syntax errors are misspelled keywords, function and variable names; non equal amount of opening and closing parentheses, brackets and braces - every open parentheses must be paired with a closed parentheses and so on.</li><li><strong>runtime errors</strong> allow you to start your code but come up during the execution. Examples of those are refering to another part of code with wrong path or memory leaks.</li><li><strong>logical errors</strong> where your code doesn&#39;t do what you intended. As an example think about business software where calculations and formulas are wrong.</li></ul><p>There are different debugging tools. Some are integrated to your development environment. But as front-end developer you can also use web browser developer tools. Most main browser have these built in.</p><p>Here are some good ressources about debugging and Chrome Dev Tools but I recommend to check out those after you have at least started with HTML, CSS and JavaScript topics.</p><p>Exhaustive Youtube playlist about Chrome Dev Tools. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtS7XdlvrF9-JnNZ-8uDg-gH959PLti8a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome Dev Tools</a></p><p>A good interarctive tutorial about debugging and errors in JavaScript. <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#debugging" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Debugging</a></p>',8);a.render=function(o,t,a,s,i,g){return e(),r("div",null,[n])};export default a;export{t as __pageData};
